# React Native coding challenge #
A demo app to convert international currencies, using fresh conversion rates from the European Central Bank. The user chooses the input and output currencies, types any input amount, and is given an output amount.

### Install and build
In the project root:
```$ yarn``` (or `$npm i`, if you prefer)
Then:
```$ react-native run-ios``` or ```$ react-native run-android```

### Notes
I focused on making the UI clean and simple. I did this by minimizing visible elements, aligning elements together, and choosing a color scheme with gentle, cool tones. While there are even further measures possible in creating ideal layout for both iOS and Android, I feel confident in my cross-platform styles.
